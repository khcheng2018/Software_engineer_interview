# Software engineer interview questions
I have collected the questions I encountered during my interview for the position of software engineer. The answers I provide may not be accurate, but they serve as a starting point for further investigation. Please feel free to let me know if you have any comments.
## C/C++
What is the difference between C and C++? <br />
What is the difference between #define constant and variable within a function or the main loop? <br />
**Ans**: There are two differences between them. <br />
  1. In #define constant, constants are unchangeable. Variables defined within functions or the main loop are changeable.
  2. In #define constant, constants do not take up memory. Variables defined within functions or the main loop take up memory.

## Recursive funcation
What is a recursive function? <br />
What is the most important part of a recursive function? <br />
What is(are) the difference(s) between a recursive function and a for loops?

## Finite state machine
How do you implement the finite state machine? <br />
**Ans**: The finite state machine can be implemented using the conditional statement (if-else, switch case), and the lookup table (a 2D array or an array of structure).
